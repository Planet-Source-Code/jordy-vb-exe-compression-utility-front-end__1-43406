This VB Add-In is a GUI for the UPX compression utility (The Ultimate Packer for eXecutables, Copyright (c) 1996-2002 Markus Oberhumer & Laszlo Molnar)
To use it: 

1. Go to http://upx.sourceforge.net and download the upx utility
2. Decompress this ZIP file into some folder and copy UPX.EXE to this folder
3. Build the project's DLL into the same folder
4. Run Visual Basic 6.0. You should see a Compact button on the main toolbar.
5. Load a project and compile it. Press the Compact button and then [Compress] to compress your executable.

This add-in is tested with upx.exe version 1.24.
